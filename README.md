# Pappascout

Hobby scouting tool for **Pappaliiga**, a Finnish amateur CS2 league organized on the FACEIT platform.

## What it does

Pappascout generates a short written tactical summary of our team's **upcoming league opponents**:

1. Finds the opponent team's recent FACEIT matches where (nearly) the full roster played
2. Parses the match demos (Python: demoparser2 / awpy)
3. Classifies rounds (pistol / eco / force buy / full buy) per side and per map
4. Produces a concise Markdown report the team reads before the match

## Status

Early planning / development. Built as a non-commercial free-time project for a single team.

- No demo files are redistributed
- Low volume (roughly 10–30 demos per month during the season)
